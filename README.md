# Gerrymandering Impact Gap Analysis

Python scripts for analyzing gerrymandering effects using the Impact Gap metric.

## Overview

This project provides tools to analyze gerrymandering effects by calculating the "impact gap" - a metric that measures the difference between the election entropy of a voter's assigned district compared to the entropy of their geographic neighborhood or idealized average disctrict assignment.

## Usage


## Methodology

### Impact Gap Calculation
The impact gap metric measures:
1. Entropy of idealized average districts
2. Entropy of actual district assignments
3. Differential impact on voters by party
